      <h3>About Kanstellation Magazine</h3>
      <p>Kanstellation is launching its first issue this December.  We're an online publication presenting multi-genre material that explores what it means to be human in the digital age.</p>

      <h3>Open Call for Poetry</h3>
      <p>We're currently looking for poetry to include in our first and second issues.  There are no suggested themes, but we would like to see poems on the subject of technology. The topic of technology is a broad one. </p>
      <p>We are accepting all forms of poetry, not limited to, but including: experimental/hybrid, traditional/formal, prose poetry, short forms, long forms, found/collage, haiku, and poetry written in non-English languages (if accompanied by an English translation).</p>
      <h4>Rights and Payment</h4>
      <p>There is no reader fee. We're a new publication and excited to read your work. Kanstellation Magazine asks for exclusive rights to published pieces for a period of one month. After that, republishing with attribution is welcome.  We are currently offering a $65 honorarium for pieces we publish, paid via PayPal upon acceptance.</p>
      <h4>Process</h4>
      <p>It is the editorial policy to offer feedback and editing suggestions to poems that are on the edge of acceptance.  We value artistic vision and voice, but in order to produce a consistent publication we reserve the right to publish work that dynamically develops our evolving mission.</p>
      <h4>Submission guidelines</h4>
      <p>Please compile all pieces into one Word document (.doc/.docx) and make sure to include page breaks between each work and clearly denote titles of works so we know when each starts and ends (add bold, italicize, underline, etc.)</p>
      <p>Send up to 5 poems in one document of up to 15 pages.</p>
      <p>Only previously unpublished pieces are accepted. Simultaneous submissions are absolutely fine, but please be sure to notify us if any of your pieces are accepted elsewhere by replying to your original submission email.</p>
      <p>For all submissions, please include a short bio in the third person that includes your personal pronouns and your Twitter handle in the body of your email. No cover letters.</p>     
      <p>Please send all poetry submissions to editor@kanstellation.com and address your email to Kristen.</p>
